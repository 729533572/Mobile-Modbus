<hr><p>Mobile Modbus is an Android Modbus polling client using modern android UI design guidelines and design patterns such as the Action bar for navigation, a slide-in menu for settings, and appropriately scaled data-display for the device you are working on (i.e. list views on a phone, and a grid on a tablet).</p>

<p>More info to come as this project develops.  Until then feel free to follow along with my <a href="http://www.bencatlin.com">blog</a> for information, or follow me on <a href="http://www.twitter.com/bigcat2k">twitter</a>.</p>

<h3>Contributing / Reporting Issues</h3>

<hr><p>Eventually I'll put some basic stuff here to know how to contribute more easily - but basically for now, fork the project on github, and submit a pull request and I'll evaluate it and add it if it is in line with what we are after for the goals of the project.</p>

<p>If you see anything wrong with it in any way, just use github to file an issue ticket (please don't comment on my blog about it).</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<hr><p>This project relies on three libraries:</p>

<ul>
<li> <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/modbus4j/">Modbus4J</a> - a Java Modbus library that is pretty extensible and full-featured with some nice batching functions that we (are going to) make use of.  At some point in the not too distant future, I will push a git-ified version of the original library in CVS on source forge to my github account.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock">ActionBarSherlock</a> - this is a library that gives us the action bar design pattern that is basically free in 3.0+, but in 2.x versions of android.</li>
<li> <a href="https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu">SlidingMenu</a> - a library that makes it easy to generate a slide-in menu.  We (will) use this for sliding in the connection/slave/server device settings as well as the register settings from the left on demand.  This allows the most screen real-estate for displaying the information that is important the most often - which is the register data.  Please review the section in the readme file on modifying for use with ActionbarSherlock.</li>
</ul><p>Once you have these libraries downloaded - add the two android-specific libraries to your eclipse workspace by selecting new project from file - and then importing the 'library' folder from within those projects.</p>

<p>Then, once they are imported, add them as libraries to the Properties - Android section of the main Mobile Modbus project.</p>

<p>Next import the Modbus4J project as a new eclipse project - right now I'm just checking the whole damned thing out from CVS on sourceforge.   And, then go to Properties - Java Build Path, and click the "Projects" tab at the top.  Now click "Add" and select the modbus4j project from your current eclipse workspace.</p>

<p>This should get you all the libraries you need.</p>
